# DotNetOptimizations
Several benchmarks and optimizations for .NET, usually unsafe stuff.

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks here are all made by [BenchmarkDotNet](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/index.htm) . If you wanna run the code and benchmarks yourself then you will need the BenchmarkDotNet installed. You can check [here](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/Guides/GettingStarted.htm) to see how to get started.
